Entropy = 7.987719 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 16501 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 16501 samples is 284.06, and randomly
would exceed this value 10.20 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 128.3122 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.112727273 (error 0.92 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000930 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
