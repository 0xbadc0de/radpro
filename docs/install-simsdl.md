# Rad Pro simulator

The Rad Pro simulator is a tool used for developing Rad Pro, but you can also download it to try the firmware before installing.

Download the appropriate simulator from the [Rad Pro releases](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/releases).

Measurements are simulated. The arrow keys let you navigate the menus, the spacebar key functions as the ok/power key. You can also hold the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 keys pressed to simulate increased levels of radiation.
