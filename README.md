## Introduction

Rad Pro is a custom firmware that enhances the capabilities of several commercially available Geiger counters, including the [FS2011](docs/devices/FS2011/install.md), [YT-203B](docs/devices/FS2011/install.md), [Bosean FS-600](docs/devices/Bosean%20FS-600,%20FS-1000/install.md), [Bosean FS-1000](docs/devices/Bosean%20FS-600,%20FS-1000/install.md) and [FNIRSI GC-01](docs/devices/FNIRSI%20GC-01/install.md).

With Rad Pro, you can:

* Measure instantaneous radiation rate.
* Measure average radiation rate for performing surveys.
* Measure cumulative dose.
* Set up user-adjustable rate and dose alarms.
* Plot radiation rate history (10 minutes, 1 hour and 24 hours).
* Log data to the built-in flash memory or live on a computer, optionally sending the data to the [gmcmap.com](https://gmcmap.com), [radmon.org](https://radmon.org) and [safecast.org](https://map.safecast.org) radiation monitoring websites.
* Generate true random data: secure passwords (alphanumeric, full ASCII), random hexadecimal and decimal numbers, dice throws (4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 12-sided and 20-sided) and coin flips.
